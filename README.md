# SpaceInvaders-Unity
C# scripts for a Space Invaders game built in Unity.

This was orginally started as part of an assessment with a game dev firm.

---

Some of the scripts were provided as part of the assessment thus I do not take credit for these...

- CollisionDetect.cs
- ISpaceInvaders.cs
- MonoSingleton.cs

The rest was mostly my work with a some basic structure code provided by the assessors.
